<p>
The <code>Cookies</code> trait provides several methods to handle cookie operations within your Laravel application. These methods help ensure that your application's cookies are correctly set up and managed for testing purposes.

        This snippet sets a cookie with a specified name and value. It allows you to simulate setting cookies in your application.
    </p>
</article-paragraphs>
<code-snippet
        gherkin="When cookie :name with value :value is set"
        php="
    /**
     * @When cookie :name with value :value is set
     * @When cookie named :name with value :value is created
     * @When cookie :name with value :value is added
     */
    public function setCookie(string $name, string $value): void
    {
        \$cookieFactory = \$this->getContainer()->make(CookieFactory::class);
        \$cookieFactory->queue(\$name, \$value);
    }"></code-snippet>
<article-paragraphs>
    <p>
        The <code>assertCookieValue</code> method verifies that a cookie with the specified name has the expected value. This is useful for ensuring that cookies are set correctly in your application.
    </p>
</article-paragraphs>
<code-snippet
        gherkin="Then cookie :name should have value :value"
        php="
    /**
     * @Then cookie :name should have value :value

    public function assertCookieValue(string $name, string $value): void
    {
        \$cookieValue = \$this->request->cookies->get(\$name);
        Assert::assertEquals(\$value, \$cookieValue, 'Cookie \$name does not have the expected value \$value.');
    }"></code-snippet>
<article-paragraphs>
    <p>
        The <code>deleteCookie</code> method removes a cookie with the specified name. This is useful for testing scenarios where you need to clear cookies.
    </p>
</article-paragraphs>
<code-snippet
        gherkin="When cookie :name is deleted"
        php="
    /**
     * @When cookie :name is deleted

    {
        \$cookieFactory = \$this->getContainer()->make(CookieFactory::class);
        \$cookieFactory->queue(\$cookieFactory->forget(\$name));
    }"></code-snippet>
<article-paragraphs>
    <p>
        The <code>assertCookieNotExists</code> method verifies that a cookie with the specified name does not exist. This is useful for ensuring that cookies are properly deleted or not set.
    </p>
</article-paragraphs>
<code-snippet
        gherkin="Then the cookie :name should be missing"
        php="
    /**
     * @Then the cookie :name should be missing
     * @Then the cookie named :name should not be present
     */
    public function assertCookieNotExists(string \$name): void
    {
        \$cookieValue = \$this->request->cookies->get(\$name);
        Assert::assertNull(\$cookieValue, 'Cookie \$name should not exist.');
    }"></code-snippet>
<article-paragraphs>
    <p>
        The <code>assertCookiesExist</code> method verifies that multiple cookies with specified names and values are present. This is useful for checking the state of several cookies in your application.
    </p>

<code-snippet
        gherkin="Then the following cookies should be present:
            | name  | value  |

    /**

     * @Then the cookies should be set to:
     */
    public function assertCookiesExist(TableNode \$table): void
    {
        foreach (\$table as \$row) {
            \$cookieValue = \$this->request->cookies->get(\$row['name']);
            Assert::assertEquals(\$row['value'], \$cookieValue, 'Cookie {\$row['name']} does not have the expected value {\$row['value']}.');
