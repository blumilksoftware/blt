  <p>
    In the development and testing of Laravel applications, the environment
    configuration plays a crucial role. The environment settings determine how
    your application behaves under different conditions and scenarios. By
    configuring the environment appropriately, you can simulate production,
    development, and testing setups to ensure your application is robust and
    reliable.
  </p>
  <p>
    This chapter covers various aspects of environment configuration in Laravel,
    including how to change configuration values dynamically during testing with
    Behat. You will learn how to set up different environments, modify
    configuration settings for specific test scenarios, and leverage these
    configurations to catch potential issues early in the development cycle.
    Understanding and managing environment configurations effectively will help
    you create more resilient and adaptable applications.

<section-header>Changing Laravel configuration values</section-header>
<article-paragraphs>
  <p>
    When working with Laravel applications, you might need to change
    configuration values during your tests to simulate different environments or
    settings. This is particularly useful in Behat testing to ensure your
    application behaves correctly under various configurations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following examples demonstrate how to modify configuration values for
    your Laravel application during Behat tests. By setting different
    configuration parameters, you can test specific scenarios and edge cases
    more effectively.

<code-snippet>
  Given application is booted with config:
      | config | value |
      | app.env | local |</code-snippet>

<article-paragraphs>
  <p>
    In this example, the application is configured to run in the 'local'
    environment. This setting is ideal for development and testing purposes. By
    ensuring that 'app.env' is set to 'local', you can simulate the behavior of
    your application as it would run on a developer's machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adjusting the environment configuration helps in identifying issues that
    might not be apparent in production but could affect development or testing
    environments.

  Given application is booted with config:
      | config | value |
      | telescope.enabled | true |</code-snippet>

  <p>
    Here, we enable Laravel Telescope, a debugging assistant for Laravel.
    Enabling Telescope during tests can help you monitor and debug the actions
    that your application performs during a Behat scenario.
  </p>
  <p>
    By enabling or disabling certain features like Telescope, you can ensure
    that your application behaves correctly with different toolsets and
    configurations, leading to more robust and reliable software.
