<article-header>Context Classes vs. Traits</article-header>
<article-paragraphs>
<p>
In this package, both context classes and traits are utilized to extend the functionality and modularity of your Behat tests. While context classes serve as the primary structure for defining test behaviors, traits allow you to encapsulate and reuse common test logic across different contexts.
</p>
<p>
Traits provide predefined methods that can be included in your context classes to perform specific actions. By using traits, you can avoid code duplication and ensure consistency across your test scenarios. For example, the <code class="underline">HttpResponse</code> trait includes methods for asserting the status and content of HTTP responses, while the <code class="underline">Translations</code> trait provides methods for testing translation features in your Laravel application.

To use a trait in your context class, simply include it using the use keyword. Here is an example of how to include the <code class="underline">HttpResponse</code> trait in a context class:

    <code-block>
        &lt;?php

        declare(strict_types=1);

        namespace Blumilk\BLT\Features;

        use Behat\Behat\Context\Context;
        use Blumilk\BLT\Features\Traits\HttpResponse;

        class HttpResponseContext implements Context
        {
            use HttpResponse;
        }
