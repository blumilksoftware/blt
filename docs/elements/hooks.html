    <p>Hooks are special methods that run at specified points in your test suite's lifecycle. They allow you to execute
        code before and after certain events, providing a powerful mechanism to manage your test environment and ensure
        consistency across your tests.</p>

        Reboot after feature
    </section-header>
    <p>The <code class="text-sky-600">Blumilk\BLT\Features\Hooks\RebootAfterFeature</code> hook is designed to ensure that the system under test is reset to a clean state after each
        feature is executed. </p>
    <code-block>
        /**
        * @afterFeature
        */
        public static function rebootAfterFeature(): void
        {
        $bootstrapper = static::getRebootAfterFeatureBootstrapper();
        $bootstrapper->boot();
        }
    </code-block>

    <section-header>
        Refresh database before scenario
    </section-header>
    <p>
        The <code class="text-sky-600">Blumilk\BLT\Features\Hooks\RefreshDatabaseBeforeScenario</code> hook is designed to reset the database to a known state before each scenario
        is executed. This ensures that each test scenario runs with a fresh and consistent database, which is crucial
        for maintaining the integrity and reliability of your test results.
    </p>
    <code-block>
        public function refreshDatabaseBeforeScenario(): void
        {
        $this->refreshDatabase();
        }
    </code-block>

    <p class="font-semibold">To use hooks simply include them in your feature context</p>

    <code-block>
        use Blumilk\BLT\Features\Hooks\RefreshDatabaseBeforeScenario;

        class FeatureContext extends Toolbox implements Context
        {
        use RefreshDatabaseBeforeScenario;

        public function __construct()
        {
        $bootstrapper = new LaravelBootstrapper();
        $bootstrapper->boot();
        }
        }
    </code-block>
