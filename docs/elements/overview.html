<article-paragraf>
 <p>This package is meant to streamline testing Laravel apps with Behat. It provides ready to use code snippets and contexts for testing Laravel applications.</p>
 <div class="m-6"></div>
<p>
 Our goal is to provide a set of tools that will help you write tests faster and more efficiently. We want to make sure that you can focus on writing tests that matter, rather than spending time on boilerplate code.
 We would love to make it so no other code is needed for testing, but we are not there yet. We are constantly working on improving the package and adding new features.
