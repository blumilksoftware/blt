      <article-header>Environment</article-header>
      <article-paragraphs>
        <p>In the development and testing of Laravel applications, the environment configuration plays a crucial role.
          The environment settings determine how your application behaves under different conditions and scenarios. By
          configuring the environment appropriately, you can simulate production, development, and testing setups to
          ensure your application is robust and reliable.</p>
        <p>This chapter covers various aspects of environment configuration in Laravel, including how to change
          configuration values dynamically during testing with Behat. You will learn how to set up different
          environments, modify configuration settings for specific test scenarios, and leverage these configurations to
          catch potential issues early in the development cycle. Understanding and managing environment configurations
          effectively will help you create more resilient and adaptable applications.</p>

      <section-header>Changing Laravel configuration values</section-header>
      <article-paragraphs>
        <p>When working with Laravel applications, you might need to change configuration values during your tests to
          simulate different environments or settings. This is particularly useful in Behat testing to ensure your
          application behaves correctly under various configurations.</p>
        <p>The following examples demonstrate how to modify configuration values for your Laravel application during
          Behat tests. By setting different configuration parameters, you can test specific scenarios and edge cases
          more effectively.</p>
      </article-paragraphs>

      <code-snippet>
Given application is booted with config:
    | config | value |
    | app.env | local |</code-snippet>

      <article-paragraphs>
        <p>In this example, the application is configured to run in the 'local' environment. This setting is ideal for
          development and testing purposes. By ensuring that 'app.env' is set to 'local', you can simulate the behavior
          of your application as it would run on a developer's machine.</p>
        <p>Adjusting the environment configuration helps in identifying issues that might not be apparent in production
          but could affect development or testing environments.</p>
      </article-paragraphs>

      <code-snippet>
Given application is booted with config:
    | config | value |
    | telescope.enabled | true |</code-snippet>

      <article-paragraphs>
        <p>Here, we enable Laravel Telescope, a debugging assistant for Laravel. Enabling Telescope during tests can
          help you monitor and debug the actions that your application performs during a Behat scenario.</p>
        <p>By enabling or disabling certain features like Telescope, you can ensure that your application behaves
          correctly with different toolsets and configurations, leading to more robust and reliable software.</p>
