### Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your feature or bug fix (`git checkout -b "#1-add-functionality"`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add new feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin "#1-add-functionality"`).

**Your pull request should:**

- Include a clear description of what your changes do.
- Reference any related issues.
- Follow the project's coding standards.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally.

### Code Style

- Keep code styled as in the repository. 
- You can use `composer csf` for fixing code style.
